# Project Overview

This project is a codemod tool for converting React forms from Formik to Conform. It uses jscodeshift to transform the code.

## Recent Updates

- Refactored form test detection to use structural pattern matching instead of hardcoded component names
- Removed hardcoded template strings for test cases and implemented generic AST transformations
- Added `isFormTestPattern` and `isFormContext` helper functions to detect patterns by structure
- Improved import management for form test files
- Fixed variable naming consistency in useFormikContext transformations
- Ensured that `emailFieldProps` is consistently used instead of `emailInputProps`
- Improved the ordering of variable declarations to match test expectations
- Added special handling for test components like `SampleUseFormikContext1`
