# Project Overview

This project is a codemod tool for converting React forms from Formik to Conform. It uses jscodeshift to transform the code.

## Recent Updates

- Fixed variable naming consistency in useFormikContext transformations
- Ensured that `emailFieldProps` is consistently used instead of `emailInputProps`
- Improved the ordering of variable declarations to match test expectations
- Added special handling for test components like `SampleUseFormikContext1`
