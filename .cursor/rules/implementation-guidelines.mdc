# Implementation Guidelines

Please avoid implementing processes that exactly match specific implementations, as they lack versatility and reusability.

## Avoid Hardcoding

- Never use hardcoded string replacements for specific test cases
- Implementations should be general and handle a variety of inputs
- All transformations must be done programmatically through AST manipulation
- If a specific pattern needs special handling, implement a generic pattern matching approach that works for similar cases
- Use utility functions that can be reused across different parts of the codebase
- Add proper error handling to ensure the code is robust even with unexpected input
