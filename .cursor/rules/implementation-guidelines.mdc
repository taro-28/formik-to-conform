# Implementation Guidelines

Please avoid implementing processes that exactly match specific implementations, as they lack versatility and reusability.

## Avoid Hardcoding

- Never use hardcoded string replacements for specific test cases
- Implementations should be general and handle a variety of inputs
- All transformations must be done programmatically through AST manipulation
- If a specific pattern needs special handling, implement a generic pattern matching approach that works for similar cases
- Use utility functions that can be reused across different parts of the codebase
- Add proper error handling to ensure the code is robust even with unexpected input
- Avoid using regular expressions to directly manipulate source code strings - always prefer AST operations
- Never rely on specific component names, variable names or file patterns in transformation logic
- When generating variable names or identifiers, use functions that apply consistent naming conventions
- Always document special case handling with clear comments explaining why the exceptions exist
- Use mapping structures (like dictionaries/objects) to handle special cases, rather than hardcoded if-statements
- Keep all special case handling in one centralized location to make maintenance easier
- Never use string includes checks like `code.includes("ComponentName")` to detect patterns - use AST analysis instead
- Avoid returning static template strings - instead transform the actual code programmatically
- Detect code patterns by structure rather than by specific names
- Use helper functions that can analyze code structure to make detection patterns more robust

## Pattern Detection Best Practices

- Instead of checking for specific component names, check for common structural patterns
- When detecting forms, look for form-like elements (inputs, buttons with type="submit")
- For specialized components, check their structure and behavior rather than names
- Create helper functions that can detect patterns based on AST structure
- When possible, use multiple signals to confirm a pattern (e.g., exports + component structure)
- Pattern detection functions should accept the JSCodeshift instance as parameter
- Always pass AST manipulation tools (like JSCodeshift) as parameters to helper functions

## Special Cases and Tests

- When test fixtures expect specific variable names (like `emailFieldProps`), ensure these are consistently maintained across all transformation functions
- For component-specific special handling, use targeted functions that don't affect other components
- Be careful with the order of variable declarations, especially when tests expect a specific sequence
- When handling test fixtures, document why special handling is needed to make it clear for future development
- If you find yourself implementing special test-only code paths, consider refactoring to use a more general approach
- Always add tests for any special pattern handling to ensure it's properly maintained
- Use configurable mappings for special cases that need to be maintained for backward compatibility

## Code Quality and Type Safety

- Always provide explicit type annotations for variables, especially when working with complex AST nodes
- Create helper functions with proper type signatures to handle repetitive AST manipulation operations
- Avoid type assertions (as any) whenever possible - use proper type guards instead
- When working with JSCodeshift API, ensure your manipulation preserves the correct node types
- All helper functions should have JSDoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return types
- When modifying node properties, verify that the modification maintains type compatibility
