# Testing

To run tests: `pnpm test  --run`

## Test Fixtures

- Test fixtures expect specific variable naming conventions (e.g., `emailFieldProps` instead of `emailInputProps`)
- The ordering of variable declarations in test fixtures is important and should be maintained
- When fixing test failures, ensure you understand both the input and expected output formats
- Pay special attention to how components like `SampleUseFormikContext1` are transformed
